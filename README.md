# calculator

This project performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. The user
is prompted to enter two numbers and an operator, and the result of the
operation is calculated and displayed.

---

# Getting Started

To use this project, simply run the `main.py` file in your Python environment.
You will be prompted to enter two numbers and an operator. The result of the
operation will be displayed if it is not `None`.

---

# Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3 to be installed on your system.

---

# File Structure

This project contains the following files:

- `main.py`: the main script that performs the arithmetic operations
- `input_module.py`: a module that retrieves the numbers and operator from the
   user
- `logic.py`: a module that determines the operation to be performed based on
   the inputs
- `addition.py`: a module that performs addition
- `subtraction.py`: a module that performs subtraction
- `multiplication.py`: a module that performs multiplication
- `division.py`: a module that performs division
- `exponentiation.py`: a module that performs exponentiation

# How It Works

The main.py file imports the input_module and logic modules and uses their
functions to retrieve the user inputs and determine the operation to be
performed. The result is then calculated and displayed if it is not `None`.
